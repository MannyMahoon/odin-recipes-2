About the Project:

In this project, I am using my HTML knowledge to practice and build a basic recipe website


Skills demonstrated:

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It will build on my current HTML skills initially. At a later time, the project will be revisited to include styling through the implementation of CSS.
